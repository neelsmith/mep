# About Mise en Page #

The Mise en Page project presents a new interpretation of the visual layout of the richest and oldest complete manuscript of the *Iliad*.  The programs hosted here query data published by the Homer Multitext project, and analyze the results automatically.  The site also hosts an interactive article by Nikolas Churik and Neel Smith interpreting the  automated analyses.

Mise en Page is replicable scholarship.  The project's technical documentation includes complete information on how to clone and modify an independent installation of the project.
