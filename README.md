## Overview ##

`mep` computes the numbers of *scholia* and word-tokens on a given page of the Venetus A manuscript, and generates two analyses of the spatial arrangement of *scholia* on the page.  The first analysis implements the theories of Maria Maniaci;  the second implements a modification of Maniaci's theories proposed by Nik Churik, and described in an article in the "Built-upon" series.
